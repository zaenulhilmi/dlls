## Functionalities

- Sign up & Login to the App 
    A simple sign up and login using email and password, it will return a JWT token that will be used for all other requests.

- User Able to only view, swipe left (pass) and swipe right (like) 10 other dating profiles in total (pass + like) in 1 day.
    This will be a actions table that will store 
    - user ID
    - target user ID
    - action (pass or like)
    - datetime
- Same profiles canâ€™t appear twice in the same day.
    Need to check if the user has already swiped on the target user ID in the same day. 


- User Able to purchase premium packages that unlocks one premium feature of your choosing. A few examples:
    - No swipe quota for user
    - Verified label for user

    simplifying this to just a boolean value in the user table.
    The case for swiping quota will be handled in the service layer by checking if the user has a premium account or not.
